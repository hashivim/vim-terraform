## Overview: vim-terraform

This plugin adds a `:!Terraform` command that runs terraform, with tab
completion of subcommands. It also sets up `*.tf`, `*.tfvars`, and
`*.tfstate` files to be highlighted as HCL, HCL, and JSON respectively.

## Usage

Allow vim-terraform to align settings automatically with Tabularize.

    let g:terraform_align=1

Allow vim-terraform to automatically fold (hide until unfolded) sections of terraform code. Defaults to 0 which is off.

    let g:terraform_fold_sections=1

Allow vim-terraform to automatically format `*.tf` and `*.tfvars` files with `terraform fmt`.
You can also do this manually with the `:!TerraformFmt` command.

    let g:terraform_fmt_on_save=1

## Updating vim-terraform
Note, this is only for maintainers of the `vim-terraform` project.

When a new version of Terraform drops, you can run the following where x.x.x is a version such as 0.11.11

    ./update_automagic.sh x.x.x

At this point, add the modified files to a git branch and open a pull request.

	git checkout -b "feature/update-to-terraform-$VERSION"
	git add $FILE
	git commit -m "Message about update"
	git push

Add another maintainer to the pull request and await confirmation.
