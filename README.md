## Call For Maintainers

This plugin, along with others like it, is now maintained by the
[HashiVim](http://hashivim.github.io/) organization, which is looking for
additional maintainers and contributors.
See the HashiVim home page for further information.

## Overview: vim-terraform

This plugin adds a `:Terraform` command that runs terraform, with tab completion
of subcommands.
It also sets up `*.tf`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraformrc` and `terraform.rc` files to
be highlighted as HCL and `*.tfstate` as JSON.

---

## Installation

With [Vim 8 packages](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/repeat.txt.html#packages):

    git clone https://github.com/hashivim/vim-terraform.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-terraform

With [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

    git clone https://github.com/hashivim/vim-terraform.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-terraform

With [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), add the following to `~/.vimrc`:

    Plugin 'hashivim/vim-terraform'

---

## Usage

Allow vim-terraform to align settings automatically with Tabularize.

    let g:terraform_align=1

Allow vim-terraform to automatically fold (hide until unfolded) sections of
terraform code.
Defaults to 0 which is off.

    let g:terraform_fold_sections=1

Allow vim-terraform to automatically format `*.tf` and `*.tfvars` files with
`terraform fmt`.
You can also do this manually with the `:TerraformFmt` command.

    let g:terraform_fmt_on_save=1

Allow vim-terraform to use a custom path for the terraform binary.
Defaults to terraform (found in $PATH)

    let g:terraform_binary_path="/usr/local/Cellar/terraform/0.13.5/bin/terraform"

---

## Use with other HCL files

This is a terraform plugin, with terraform-specific features.
However, some users have reported that it also works well for other files that
use the Hashicorp Configuration Language.

If you want to use this plugin for non-terraform files, the simplest way is to
teach vim to treat them as terraform.
For example to use this plugin for files with suffix `.hcl`, put the following
in `~/.vim/ftdetect/terraform.vim`:

```viml
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.hcl set filetype=hcl.terraform
```

---

## Updating vim-terraform

Note, this is only for maintainers of the `vim-terraform` project.

When a new version of Terraform drops, you can run the following where x.x.x is
a version such as 0.11.11

    ./update_automagic.sh x.x.x

At this point, add the modified files to a git branch and open a pull request.

    git checkout -b "feature/update-to-terraform-$VERSION"
    git add $FILE
    git commit -m "Message about update"
    git push

Add another maintainer to the pull request and await confirmation.

## Running tests
